Q2. Explain the concept of event delegation and provide a scenario where it is beneficial.


Ans:- 

Event Delegation is a technique in JavaScript where instead of attaching event listeners to individual elements, you attach a single 
event listener to a parent element. This listener handles events for all of its child elements due to event bubbling.

Scenario:

Dynamic Content: If you have a list of items that can be added or removed dynamically, attaching event listeners to each item would be 
nefficient. Instead, you can attach a single event listener to the parent <ul> or <ol> element. This way, the parent handles events for 
all current and future child elements.

Example:

html

<ul id="parent-list">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<script>
  document.getElementById('parent-list').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
      alert('You clicked on: ' + event.target.textContent);
    }
  });
</script
