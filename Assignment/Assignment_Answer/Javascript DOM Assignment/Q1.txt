Q1. Explain the DOM and its role in Web development.


Ans :- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the page (e.g., elements, attributes, text). The DOM allows developers to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically using JavaScript.

Role in Web Development:

Dynamic Content Updates: The DOM enables developers to update the content of a web page without reloading it.

Event Handling: It allows developers to respond to user interactions (e.g., clicks, keypresses) by attaching event listeners to DOM elements.

Styling: Developers can dynamically change the styles of elements using JavaScript.

Access and Manipulation: The DOM provides methods to access and modify elements, attributes, and text content.
