Explain the purpose of the addEventListener method in JavaScript and how it facilitates event handling in
the DOM.


Ans: - 

The addEventListener method is used to attach an event handler to a specific DOM element. It allows developers to define how the 
application should respond to user interactions (e.g., clicks, keypresses, mouse movements).

Purpose:

Flexibility: You can attach multiple event listeners to the same element for the same event.

Separation of Concerns: It separates JavaScript code from HTML, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Dynamic Event Handling: You can add or remove event listeners dynamically during runtime.

Example:

html
Copy
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  });
</script>
