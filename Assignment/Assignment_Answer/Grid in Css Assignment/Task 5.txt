Question - Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.

Ans:- 

In Css Grid Layout, justify-items and justify-self are two properties used to align items within grid cells. While they both control 
alignment, they operate at different levels.


justify-items - 

Targets All items within a specific grid container and Controls The horizontal alignment of items within their individual cells.

The effect of this property is dependent of the layout mode we are in:  In grid layouts, it aligns the items inside their grid areas on 
the inline axis. In block-level layouts, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis.For absolutely-positioned 
elements, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis, accounting for the offset values of top, left, bottom, 
and right.

justify-self - 

Targets individual items within a grid container and Controls The horizontal alignment of a specific item within its cell.

The effect of this property is dependent of the layout mode we are in: In grid layouts, it aligns an item inside its grid area on the 
inline axis. In block-level layouts, it aligns an item inside its containing block on the inline axis.For absolutely-positioned elements,
it aligns an item inside its containing block on the inline axis, accounting for the offset values of top, left, bottom, and right.
