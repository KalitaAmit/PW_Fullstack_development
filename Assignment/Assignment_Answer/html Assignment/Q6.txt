Q6. Explain the difference between <div> and <span> elements in HTML. When would you use each?

Ans: - 

Both <div> and <span> are used for grouping elements, but they serve different purposes in terms of layout and styling.

1. <div> (Block-Level Container)

A block-level element that takes up the full width of its parent container.
It starts on a new line and is used to group larger sections of content.
Commonly used for layout structuring in combination with CSS and JavaScript.

Example:

<div style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 10px;">
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>


Usage of <div>

To group multiple elements (like text, images, and buttons) together.
To apply CSS styling to a larger section of the page.
To create layouts (e.g., grid systems, flexbox structures).


2. <span> (Inline Container)
An inline element that only takes up as much width as its content.
Does not start on a new line.
Typically used to style small pieces of text within a paragraph or heading.

Example :

<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">highlighted</span> word in a sentence.</p>
Usage of <span>

To apply styling (e.g., color, font changes) to a small portion of text.
To modify inline content without affecting the surrounding layout.
To wrap text inside JavaScript interactions (e.g., tooltips, dynamic updates).
