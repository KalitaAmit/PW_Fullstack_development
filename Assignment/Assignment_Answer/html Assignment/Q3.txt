Q3. What is the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples.

Ans:- 

 Block-Level Element: 

Always start on a new line and take up the full width available.
They create a block of content, meaning they push other elements to a new line.
They can contain both block-level and inline elements.

Examples:

(1) <div>This is a block-level element.</div>

(2) <p>This is a paragraph, which is also block-level.</p>

(3) <h1>Heading 1</h1>

(4) <section>This is a section.</section>

Common Block-Level Elements:
<div>
<p> (Paragraph)
<h1> to <h6> (Headings)
<section>
<article>
<footer>
<header>
<ul> and <ol> (Lists)
<table>


Inline Element 

Do not start on a new line; they stay within the same line as adjacent elements.
They take up only as much width as needed for their content.
Typically used for styling text, links, or embedding content within block elements.

Examples:

(1) <span>This is an inline element.</span>

(2) <a href="#">This is a link (inline).</a>

(3)<strong>Bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.

Common Inline Element:
<a> (Anchor/Link)
<span>
<strong> (Bold)
<em> (Italic)
<img> (Image)
<label> (Form label)
<code> (Inline code)
<input> (Form input fields)
