Difference Between Absolute URL and Relative URL in HTML

URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are used to link resources like web pages, images, or scripts in HTML. 

There are two types of URLs: Absolute URLs and Relative URLs.

(1) Absolute URL
An absolute URL specifies the full web address, including the protocol (http:// or https://), domain name, and the file path. It always points to the same location, regardless of where the document is located.

Use Case: When linking to external websites or resources.

Example:

<a href="https://www.example.com/about.html">Visit About Page</a>
https://www.example.com/about.html â†’ Full web address (Absolute URL).
The link works from any website.

(2) Relative URL
A relative URL specifies a path relative to the current document's location. It does not include the domain name, making it shorter 
and more flexible for linking within the same website.

Use Case: When linking to pages within the same website.

Example:

<a href="about.html">Visit About Page</a>

Only "about.html" is mentioned, meaning the browser looks for the file within the same directory.
The link will only work within the same website.
