Q7. What is the purpose of the alt attribute in the <img> tag? Why is it important for accessibility and SEO?

Ans: - 

The alt (alternative text) attribute in the <img> tag provides a text description of an image. It is displayed when the image fails to\
load and is used by screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users.

alt Attribute is important

(1) Accessibility for Visually Impaired Users

Screen readers read the alt text aloud, helping users understand the image content.
For Non-Visual Browsers:
Some browsers (like text-based browsers) cannot display images but can show the alt text.

Example:

<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A golden retriever playing in the park.">
Without alt: A visually impaired user wonâ€™t know what the image represents.
With alt: A screen reader announces: "A golden retriever playing in the park."

(2) SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps search Engines Understand Images

search engines cannot "see" images but can read the alt text to index the content.
Improves Image Search Rankings:
Images with descriptive alt text are more likely to appear in Google Image Search results.
Enhances Website Ranking:
Websites with accessible images score higher in SEO rankings.

Example for SEO-Friendly alt:

<img src="web-design-tips.jpg" alt="10 essential web design tips for beginners.">

Good alt text: Descriptive, relevant, and keyword-optimized.
Bad alt text: "image1.jpg" or "picture" (too vague).
