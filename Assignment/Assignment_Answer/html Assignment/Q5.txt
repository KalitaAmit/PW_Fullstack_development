Q5. What is the Document Object Model (DOM), and how does it relate to HTML?

Ans: - 


The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure. 
It allows JavaScript and other programming languages to interact with and modify web pages dynamically.

DOM Relate to HTML .When a browser loads an HTML document, it converts the document into a structured DOM tree.
Every HTML element becomes a node in the tree, allowing programs to access and manipulate them.
Dynamic Webpage Interaction

Using JavaScript, developers can change content, styles, and structure of the webpage without reloading the page.

Example: Changing the text of a paragraph dynamically.

<p id="demo">Hello, World!</p>
<script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "Hello, DOM!";
</script>
Hierarchy in the DOM

The document is represented in a tree-like hierarchy:
Root Node: <html>
Child Nodes: <head> and <body>
Further Child Nodes: <title>, <h1>, <p>, etc.
