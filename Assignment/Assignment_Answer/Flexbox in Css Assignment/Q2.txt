Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
(1) justify-content 
(2) align-item 
(3) gap 
(4) flex-direction
(5) flex-wrap

Ans:- 
(1) justify-content

The justify-content property aligns flex items along the main axis (horizontal by default). It controls the distribution of space between 
items and their positioning within the container. 

Key value are -
(a) flex-start - Aligns items at the start of the main axis.
(b) flex-end - Aligns items at the end of the main axis.
(c) center - Centers items along the main axis.
(d) space-between - Distributes items evenly, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
(e) space-around - Distributes items with equal space around them.

(2) align-items

The align-items property aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertical by default). It determines the positioning of items perpendicular to
the main axis.

Key value are -

(a) stretch - stretches items to fill the container along the cross axis.
(b) flex-start: Aligns items at the start of the cross axis.
(c) flex-end: Aligns items at the end of the cross axis.
(d) center: Centers items along the cross axis.

(3) gap -

The gap property controls the spacing between flex items along both the main and cross axes. Unlike margins, gap creates space between 
each item without adding space at the edges of the container. This makes it easy to create uniform spacing between items in a flex container.
gap: 20px; - Sets a 20px space between each item.
It can also accept two values, like gap: 10px 20px;, to define separate spacing for row and column gaps.

(4) flex-direction

The flex-direction property sets the direction of the main axis, determining how flex items are ordered and aligned in the container. 
Key value are -
(a) row - Items are laid out in a row from left to right.
(b) row-reverse - Items are laid out in a row from right to left.
(c) column - Items are laid out in a column from top to bottom.
(d) column-reverse - Items are laid out in a column from bottom to top.

(5) flex-wrap

The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines if they donâ€™t fit in the container. It determines how 
overflow is handled along the main axis.

Key Value are - 

(a) nowrap - All items remain on a single line, even if they overflow the container.
(b) wrap - Items wrap onto additional lines as needed, stacking below the previous line.
(c) wrap-reverse - Items wrap onto additional lines, but new lines are stacked above the previous line.
