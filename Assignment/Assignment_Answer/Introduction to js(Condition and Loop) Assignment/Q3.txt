Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans : - 

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code.
They are essential for automating tasks, iterating over collections of data, and performing actions multiple times.

use of loop: 
(1) Automation: Loops eliminate the need to write the same code repeatedly for similar tasks.
(2) Data Processing: They enable efficient processing of large datasets, such as lists, arrays, and strings.
(3) Repetition: Loops are crucial for tasks that require a specific number of repetitions or until a certain condition is met.
(4) Pattern Recognition: They can be used to identify and analyze patterns within data.


Types of Loops in JavaScript:

(1) For Loop:

syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}


(2) While Loop:

syntax:

while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}


Example:

let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
    console.log("Hello!"); // Output: "Hello!" three times
    count++;
}


(3) Do...while Loop:

syntax:

do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);



Example:

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0
    i++;
} while (i > 1); 


(4) For...of Loop:

syntax:

for (const element of iterable) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Example:

const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit); // Output: apple, banana, cherry
}
