List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML

Ans - 

The 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML are -

(1) Use Semantic HTML - 

Properly structure your HTML with semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, and <footer>. 
These tags give meaning to the content, allowing assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to navigate 
and interpret the page more easily.


(2) Provide Text Alternatives (Alt Text) -  Ensure that all images, videos, and non-text content have descriptive 
alt attributes. This allows screen readers to convey the purpose or content of the media to visually impaired 
users.

(3) Keyboard Navigation - 

Ensure that all interactive elements (links, buttons, forms) are accessible via the keyboard using the tab key. 
Elements should have a logical tabindex order, and focus states should be visually distinct to improve usability 
for those who cannot use a mouse.
