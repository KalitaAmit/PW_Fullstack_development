creating content that is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust, allowing users with different 
abilities and assistive technologies, such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation, to interact with 
the site without barriers.Web accessibility aims to provide equal access to information and functionality, 
enhancing the overall user experience. It is not only a social responsibilitybut also a part of best practices

Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

information.

users with cognitive or learning disabilities to process content.

have difficulty interacting with content in conventional ways. Features like keyboard navigation or voice control become 
crucial in such cases.
