Tag in html- 

An HTML tag is used to define the structure and layout of web pages. These tags are the fundamental building blocks 
of HTML documents, enclosed in angle brackets and containing specific keywords. Tags provide instructions to web 
browsers on how to present the content. The HTML tag typically consists of an opening tag and closing tag,
with some exceptions like self-closing tags (example -  <img />). The opening tag begins with a less-than symbol (<), followed 
by the tag name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The closing tag is similar but includes a forward slash (/) 
before the tag name to indicate the end of the element.

Element in html - 

Element is a combination of a starting tag, content, and an ending tag (In some cases only one tag, like self closing
tag)that representing a single item or unit of content on a web page.
The content can be text, images, other HTML elements, or simply empty (in the case of self-closing tags). HTML elements help 
to structure and organize content on a webpage.
