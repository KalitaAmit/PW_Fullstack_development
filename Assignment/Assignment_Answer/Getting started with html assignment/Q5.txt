What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Ans - 

The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is used to inform the web browser about the version of HTML that the page is written 
in, so it can render the content properly. It must be the very first thing in the HTML document, before any HTML tag.
There are different DOCTYPE declarations for older HTML versions (e.g., HTML4, XHTML), but they are less commonly 
used nowadays.
In HTML5 The DOCTYPE declaration is simplified and looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html> 

This tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.

The purpose of using the DOCTYPE declaration in HTML :

(1)standardizes Browser Rendering: 
It ensures that the web page is rendered in standards mode, avoiding quirks mode (where browsers render pages based 
on outdated behavior).

(2) Defines HTML Version: 
It informs the browser which version of HTML is being used, allowing the correct rules and features of that version 
to be applied.

(3) Improves Compatibility: 
It helps ensure consistency across different browsers, reducing rendering discrepancies and improving cross-browser 
compatibility.The DOCTYPE declaration helps maintain compatibility with older browsers and web technologies.

(4) Prevents Deprecation Issues: 
The declaration can prevent the use of obsolete HTML elements or attributes, promoting cleaner, more modern code.

(5) SEO Benefits: Using a correct and valid DOCTYPE can improve search engine optimization, as search engines tend 
to favor websites that follow modern web standards.
