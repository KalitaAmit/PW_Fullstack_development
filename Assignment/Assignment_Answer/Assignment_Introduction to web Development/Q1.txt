Explain the main components of client-server architecture and their functions.

 Ans:- The client-server architecture consists of two main components: clients and servers, which work together to facilitate 
 communication and resource sharing in computer networks.
 This client-server architecture enables efficient communication, resource sharing, and scalable systems, forming the foundation of 
 modern computing networks. 


Client - A client in computer networking refers to any device or software application that requests services or resources from a server. 
It's essentially the consumer in a client-serve architecture.The client is generally responsible for the user interface and may perform 
minimal processing tasks. It doesn't store large datasets or handle complex logic.
for Example suppose my flipkart account request money from my bank(eg. sbi), 
then my flipkart works as a client. 
clients include web browsers, email clients, and instant messaging ,game consoles
applications

Function:
(1) Initiates requests to the server for specific resources or services.
(2) Sends request data, such as parameters, URLs, or authentication credentials.
(3) Receives the response (data, content) from the server and displays or processes it for the end-user.
(4) Typically handles the user interface (UI) and may perform some local processing tasks.
(5) Display requested data


Server - A server is a high-powered computer or software application designed to process client requests and deliver resources or services.
Servers are typically designed to be continuously available, as clients may request services at any time.Example: A cloud storage server like 
Google Drive is available 24/7 so that clients (users) can access their files anytime.
Types of Servers: There are many types of servers based on the services they provide:
Web Server: Serves web pages to clients (browsers).
Database Server: Provides access to databases for clients to query and update.
File Server: Allows clients to store and retrieve files.
Mail Server: Manages and delivers email messages to clients.

Function:
(1) Receives and processes the client's request.
(2) Returns the requested resource (such as an HTML page, file, or data).
(3) Manages multiple requests simultaneously from various clients, ensuring that services are available to users globally.
(4) Provides services such as file storage, database management, and web hosting. (e.g., web servers, database servers, file servers)
(5) Servers often include load balancing and redundancy to handle high traffic and ensure uptime.
