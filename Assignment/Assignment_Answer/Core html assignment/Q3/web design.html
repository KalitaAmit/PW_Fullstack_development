    <h1>web design</h1>

    <p>Web Design focuses on the aesthetics and usability of websites, crafting the visual layout, color schemes, fonts,
        and
        user interface to create an appealing and user-friendly experience. It blends creativity with user-centered
        design
        principles, ensuring that websites not only look good but also function effectively. Web designers work with
        tools like
        Adobe XD, Figma, or Sketch to create mockups and wireframes before the development process. They also consider
        responsiveness, making sure sites adapt seamlessly across devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Good
        web
        design aims to engage users while maintaining ease of navigation and accessibility.
