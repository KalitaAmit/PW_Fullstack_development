    <h1>web development</h1>

    <p>Web Development refers to the technical process of building and maintaining websites. It involves coding in
        various
        programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced technologies like React, Angular, or PHP.
        Web
        developers transform web design concepts into fully functional websites by integrating elements such as
        databases, user
        authentication, and server-side scripting. There are two main areas of web development: front-end development,
        which
        focuses on the client-side interface, and back-end development, which deals with server-side operations and
        databases.
        Effective web development ensures optimal performance, security, and a seamless user experience.</p>
